## Known Issues v0.5.0
**EPJ-2755**

Description: The system time of RKE node is inconsistent with the time of day-0 node.

Workaround: No workaround, it will be fixed in next release.

**EPJ-2126**

Description: When using ESP as the OS provider to profile the OS of the
nodes, the user name and password is not set from the package kit
config file, but set from the ESP profile.

config the node list in a Package Kit config.

**EPJ-2376**

Description: When using CAPI deploy cluster with crio as container runtime, the error message "overlayfs: unrecognized mount option "volatile" or missing value" occurs on the provisioned nodes. This message is by design of the upstream project. Refer to the [known issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/4773) of CRI-O.

Workaround: No workaround required.

**EPJ-2849**

Description: failed to pull image "10.10.10.1:9000/docker.io/library/rt-linux-detection:latest on CAPI cluster

Workaround: No workaround, it will be fixed in next release.

**EPJ-2436**

Description: Edge Conductor, version 0.5.0 does not include the latest functional and security updates. Customers should update to the latest version as it becomes available.

## Known Issues v0.4.0

**EPJ-2133**

Description: It is not possible to modify the node list in the Experience Kit, after executing `conductor init`.

Workaround: Add all nodes in the Experience Kit configuration file before executing `conductor init`.

**EPJ-2126**

Description: When using ESP as the OS provider to profile the OS of the
nodes, the user name and password is not set from the Experience Kit
config file, but set from the ESP profile.

Workaround: Use the user name and password set in the official ESP profile to
config the node list in a Experience Kit config.

**EPJ-2397**

Description: For capi-metal3, in some cases, the work node provisioning fails, and the command "kubectl get machine -n metal3" shows that the worker node status is always in provisioning state.

Workaround: Run the command "kubectl delete machine -n metal3" to delete this machine and wait for capi-metal3 to provision the worker node again.

**EPJ-2376**

Description: When using CAPI deploy cluster with crio as container runtime, there is error message "overlayfs: unrecognized mount option "volatile" or missing value" on the provisioned nodes. This message is by design of the upstream project. Refer to the [known issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/4773) of CRI-O.

Workaround: No workaround required.

**EPJ-2155**

Description: The NO_PROXY variable existing on the OS deployed node is not the same as that of the NO_PROXY variable set in EK.

Workaround: Add all private networks in OS deployed node to "global_settings" -> "no_proxy" in EK yml.

**EPJ-2849**

Description: failed to pull image "10.10.10.1:9000/docker.io/library/rt-linux-detection:latest on CAPI cluster

Workaround: No workaround, it will be fixed in next release.

**EPJ-2432**

Description: On ClusterAPI clusters, Prometheus helm deployment failed during the first and second deployments.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

**EPJ-2436**

Description: Edge Conductor, version 0.4.0 does not include the latest functional and security updates. Customers should update to the latest version as it becomes available.
